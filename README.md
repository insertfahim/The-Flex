## 🚀 Deployment**Technical Approach**:



### Production Build-   Google Places API (New) integration

```bash-   Place search functionality

npm run build-   Review data normalization

npm start-   Seamless integration with existing review system

````

**API Requirements**:

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. Connect repository to Vercel1. Google Cloud Project with Places API enabled

2. Configure environment variables2. Valid API key with Places API access

3. Automatic deployment on push to main3. Billing account (required for production usage)

4. Rate limiting considerations (quota management)

### Docker Support

````bash**Implementation Details**:

docker build -t flex-reviews-dashboard .

docker run -p 3000:3000 flex-reviews-dashboard```typescript

```// Service class for Google Reviews integration

export class GoogleReviewsService {

## 📈 Performance & Analytics    async getPlaceReviews(placeId: string): Promise<GooglePlaceDetails>;

    async searchPlace(query: string): Promise<string | null>;

- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries for fast dashboard loading}

- **API Caching**: Strategic caching for external API calls```

- **Code Splitting**: Optimized bundle sizes with Next.js

- **SEO Ready**: Meta tags and structured data for public pages**Challenges & Considerations**:



## 🧪 Testing1. **Rate Limits**: Google Places API has quota restrictions

2. **Billing**: Requires billing account for production use

```bash3. **Data Freshness**: Reviews may not be real-time

# Run all tests4. **Review Limitations**: Google limits review text length in API responses

npm test5. **Place Matching**: Accurate place identification requires careful query construction



# Run tests in watch mode**Production Readiness**:

npm run test:watch

-   ✅ Code implementation complete

# Generate coverage report-   ✅ Error handling implemented

npm run test:coverage-   ✅ Data normalization working

```-   ⚠️ Requires API key configuration

-   ⚠️ Needs quota monitoring in production
