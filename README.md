## 📋 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Flex Living developer assessment, implementing a complete reviews management system that integrates with external APIs, provides analytical insights, and manages public review displays.

### Assessment Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Hostaway Integration (Mocked)** - Complete API integration with mock data support  
✅ **Manager Dashboard** - Modern, intuitive interface for review management  
✅ **Review Display Page** - Public-facing review section with Flex Living styling  
✅ **Maps Integration** - Mapbox implementation (used instead of Google Places API)

## 🚀 Features

### Manager Dashboard

- **Property Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics and KPIs for each property
- **Review Management**: Filter, sort, and approve reviews for public display
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and recurring issues across properties
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently manage multiple reviews simultaneously
- **Performance Alerts**: Automated notifications for underperforming properties

### Public Review Display

- **Flex Living Style Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with property detail pages
- **Approved Reviews Only**: Only manager-approved reviews are displayed publicly
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Interactive Filtering**: Guests can filter reviews by rating and category

### API Integration

- **Hostaway Reviews API**: Full integration with data normalization
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatic review data synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Mock Data Support**: Comprehensive mock data for development and testing

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI Components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS (chosen over Google Places API)
- **State Management**: React Hooks + Context API
- **API Integration**: Custom API routes with data normalization
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Analytics**: Custom analytics dashboard + Vercel Analytics

### Why Mapbox Instead of Google Places API?

Mapbox was chosen over Google Places API due to:

- **No Credit Card Requirement**: Google Cloud Console requires credit card verification for API activation
- **Developer-Friendly**: More straightforward setup process for assessment purposes
- **Feature Parity**: Provides all required mapping functionality for the project
- **Cost Effective**: Better pricing structure for development and testing

## 📊 Key Design Decisions

### Data Architecture

- **Normalized Review Structure**: Standardized format across different review sources
- **Property Performance Metrics**: Calculated fields for quick dashboard insights
- **Approval Workflow**: Clear separation between internal and public-facing reviews

### UX/UI Approach

- **Product Manager Mindset**: Designed with actual property manager workflows in mind
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features accessible but not overwhelming
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design ensuring usability across devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components and keyboard navigation

### API Design

- **RESTful Structure**: Clear, predictable API endpoints
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent response formats across different sources
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with actionable messages
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient queries and caching strategies

## 🎯 Assessment Features Demonstration

### Hostaway Integration

- ✅ API integration with provided credentials (see environment setup below)
- ✅ Mock data implementation for development
- ✅ Data normalization and processing
- ✅ Error handling for API failures

### Manager Dashboard Capabilities

- ✅ Property performance overview with key metrics
- ✅ Advanced filtering (rating, category, channel, date)
- ✅ Trend analysis and recurring issue identification
- ✅ Review approval workflow
- ✅ Intuitive, product-manager-focused design

### Review Display Integration

- ✅ Consistent Flex Living styling

### Maps Integration Analysis

- ✅ Mapbox implementation completed
- ❌ Google Places API not implemented (credit card requirement)
- 📋 **Findings**: While Google Places API offers robust review data, the credit card verification requirement for Google Cloud Console API activation made it impractical for this assessment. Mapbox provides excellent mapping capabilities and property visualization features that meet the project requirements.
